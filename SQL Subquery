Here is a SQL query with a common table expression:

SELECT DISTINCT (A.country),
COUNT(DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS customer_count, total_payment
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT D.country,
SUM (E.amount) AS total_payment
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY total_payment DESC) AS top_customers
ON A.country=top_customers.COUNTRY
GROUP BY A.country, top_customers.COUNTRY,total_payment
ORDER BY total_payment DESC
